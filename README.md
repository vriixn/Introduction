# Introduction
My name is Randa, and I am a third-year Cybersecurity student at Imam Abdulrahman Bin Faisal University (IAU). I have a strong interest in technology, particularly in understanding how systems work and how they can be designed to efficiently address real-world problems.

I am looking forward to studying Machine Learning, as I am interested in how intelligent systems can analyze data, recognize patterns, and support modern technological solutions, especially in areas related to system improvement and cybersecurity.
