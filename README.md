# Introduction
# Hello

My name is Randa.
I am a third-year student at Imam Abdulrahman Bin Faisal University (IAU), majoring in Cybersecurity.

I have a strong interest in science and technology, and I am especially curious about how Machine Learning can be applied in different fields, including cybersecurity and data analysis. I enjoy learning new technical concepts and developing my skills step by step, even when the learning process feels challenging.

I am looking forward to this course and to learning the fundamentals of Machine Learning, as well as understanding how these concepts can be applied in real-world scenarios.
